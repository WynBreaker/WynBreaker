# 👋 Hi, I'm WynBreaker

I'm an **Accounting & Finance graduate pivoting into IT and Cybersecurity**.  
Currently, I’m working toward my **SC-200 certification**, building hands-on labs, and documenting my learning process along the way.  

I have developed a strong foundation in **IT Operations**, **Networking**, **Defensive Security**, and **Offensive Security**, and have completed **DevSecOps** training to understand secure software development practices.

## 🧠 Current Focus
- Specializing in Security Operations (SOC / Blue Team) with a focus on detection, response, and threat hunting
- Gaining hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure security tools (Defender, Sentinel, Entra ID, KQL)
- Preparing for SC-200 (Microsoft Security Operations Analyst) certification
- Enhancing automation and security awareness through **DevSecOps principles**  
- Running SOC lab simulations (SIEM, incident response, log analysis, alert triage)
- Practicing with Splunk and Elastic Stack (ELK) through hands-on labs (TryHackMe)
- Light exposure to offensive techniques for defensive understanding
